# Localising-diseases-on-plant-leaves:Problem Review
* I have developed a system that can detect plant diseases and localization using GRADCAM.
* Obtained a highly imbalanced dataset which was then balanced using augmentation.
* This balanced datset is then fed to two multiclass CNN models for classification called ResNet and EfficientNet
* Lastly the localizations of the input image is obtained using a GRADCAM.
